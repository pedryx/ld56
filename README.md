# Story
The world has fallen into chaos, overrun by tiny, mutated creatures resembling animals. Amid the turmoil, you’ve rediscovered ancient handling skills, granting you the ability to control your own army of these tiny creatures. Can you command them to victory against the enemy armies and restore balance to the world?

In each round, you’ll face a random enemy army, with their difficulty increasing as the rounds progress.
